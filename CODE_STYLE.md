# Code Style Guidelines

We follow each language-specific style guide for any language used in this project. In addition, we have a few additional guidelines:

- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep lines under 80 characters
- Use spaces instead of tabs
- Use double quotes for strings

If you're unsure about any aspect of the code style, please ask in the pull request or issue discussion.

Thank you for helping us maintain a consistent and readable codebase!
