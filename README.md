# GoodFood 2.0

GoodFood 2.0 is a food ordering application for Good Food, a company specializing in food services in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg.

## Origin / Context

Good Food was formed from the merger of four food companies. The company offers various food services, including conventional dining, takeout, and delivery with phone orders. Ordering is also available through a web or mobile application.

The GoodFood 2.0 project was initiated to update the existing ordering application, which had become outdated and was unable to handle more users. The objective is to create a modern, user-friendly, and modular new version that can handle a high volume of concurrent users, up to several thousand.
